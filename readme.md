# ENTERTAINMENT
by David Berner

## Notes

Time to complete: 2 hours

### Given more time I would have:

* Implemented a dropdown menu

* Cleaned up my helpers file

* Provided fall backs for Flexbox layout to support IE9 and below

* Optimised image assets


### Features:

* Uses Shell, a flexbox based lightweight CSS utility library I co-developed at Campaign Monitor. This is purely the grid and some helper functions - no cosmetics. The idea being you can quickly and robustly build a component library on top of it.

* Basic NPM build scripts to compile SCSS and autoprefix vendor properties.

* Accessible using semantic markup and ARIA landmark roles

* Uses BEM naming and namespacing for CSS classes c- for component, l- for layout, h- for helpers etc

* No javascript

* Tested and working in Firefox 39, Chrome 48, Safari 9, IE 10, 11, Edge
